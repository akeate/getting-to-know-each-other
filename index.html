<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Austin Keate from Tinley Park, Illinois. I have four older
    sisters and a lot of cousins. I am majoring in Aviation Administration
    with a minor in Air Traffic Control Management. 
    I enjoy aviation because
    the field is very interesting and always changing, allowing for a lot 
    of engagement and work to be done. Over the summer I had a overnight 
    airplane cabin cleaning job. Although I did not like my experience over
    the summer I look back and realize the mistakes that were made by management 
    that helped me gain experience for my future job.

    <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout my life I have been very active in sports both watching
        and playing. The main ones I participate in are soccer and basketball.
        They are both very fast paced and fun to play and watch. I have played
        soccer all my life and am on the team here at Lewis. Basketball on the
        other hand is more for fun. I like to play with my friends and watch
        the games, especially the Bulls.
        Another hobby that I have is watching movies, in particular horror movies.
        Last semester I took a horror film class that made me appreciate and pay 
        close attention to the details in movies and I have carried that into 
        watching movies on a regular and dissecting them. Typically, I watch movies
        alone because when I watch them with my mom she talks over it and asks 
        questions as if I know everything about the movie because I took one basic,
        intermediate class.
